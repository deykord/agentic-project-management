# APM v0.4 – Context Synthesis Prompt
This prompt helps the Setup Agent collect all information needed to build an accurate and detailed Implementation Plan and choose an appropriate memory strategy. At this stage, the Setup Agent passes control flow to this prompt.

## Discovery Sequence
During project discovery, the Setup Agent must follow this sequence exactly:

### Phase 1: Existing Material and Vision  
1. Ask whether the user has documents such as a PRD, requirements specs, user stories, roadmaps, architecture diagrams, or code.  
2. Ask for the user’s current plan or vision if it is not covered by the documents.
3. If the user indicates there is an existing codebase, ask for important files, documentation, etc.

### Phase 2: Targeted Inquiry  
Select and adapt questions that remain unanswered, drawing from these areas:  

**Project Purpose and Scope**  
- What problem does the project solve?  
- What defines success? What is the ultimate goal?  
- What are the essential features or deliverables?  

**Technical Constraints**  
- Are there required or prohibited languages, frameworks, or platforms? What is the intended tech stack?  
- Are there existing codebases, APIs, or data sources to integrate?  
- Are there performance, security, or compatibility requirements?  
- What is the deployment environment?  

**Complexity and Risks**  
- What are the anticipated challenging areas?  
- Are there known risks or blockers?  
- What is the target timeline or deadline?  

**Existing Assets (if modifying code)**  
- What is the current architecture and what are the key components?  
- What build systems or dependency managers are used?  

### Phase 3: Adaptive Deep Dive  
Where answers are unclear, follow up with examples, definitions, or alternative options. Match question depth to project complexity.

### Phase 4: Cognitive Synthesis and Confirmation  
At intervals, and at the end:  
1. Summarize all gathered information in a high-level project overview.  
2. Ask the user to confirm accuracy. Request follow-ups from the user for clarity if needed.
3. After gathering all context, ask the user to choose an APM asset format:
    - **Markdown**: Readable, concise, best for most cases.
    - **JSON**: Structured, ~15% more tokens, use if strict validation/detail is needed.
Explain both options briefly and confirm the user’s choice.

## Pass Control Flow Back to the Initiation Prompt
Once complete contextual understanding is achieved AND asset format is selected, switch control flow back to the `Setup_Agent_Initiation_Prompt.md` prompt at the Implementation Plan + Memory Root Creation Phase.

## Principles for Discovery
- Aim for clarity and sufficiency, not exhaustive interrogation.  
- Reuse any existing documentation before asking new questions.  
- Adapt language and depth to project size and user expertise.  
- Combine related questions to reduce turns.
- Be mindful of token consumption and context window limitations. Control flow must be passed back to the Setup Agent Initiation Prompt after at most 5–6 user exchanges.
